[People Groups](https://www.peoplegroups.org) is a global organization dedicated to spreading the Christianity to people all over the world. In their mission, they have collected a vast amount of data about the locations of communities of "people groups" in countries and territories all over the world.

Below are screenshots showing some of the characteristics of the data collected about people groups.
