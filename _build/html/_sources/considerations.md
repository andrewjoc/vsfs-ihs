# Considerations

The proposed method of population validation in this project is not without its limitations and strong assumptions.

There is hypothesized to be a tradeoff between the granularity of the "official" data which is compared to the dataset that is being validated. Census estimates at very specific levels (ADM3+) are more prone to error and variability. Also, comparing small communities or subgroups to the official population of a relatively larger administrative level (such as ADM1) is almost guaranteed to conclude that a population is considered plausible.

This method should be used as an initial step in population validation and can complement other available statistical or GIS techniques.
