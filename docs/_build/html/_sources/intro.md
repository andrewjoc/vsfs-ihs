# Introduction

Subnational demographic data is important to obtain as it can be used to identify areas of concern within a specific geographical region. The granular nature of the data can inform policy in various sectors and can contribute to effective decision-making at both local and national levels. As a result, policymakers, scientists, public health officials, and important decision makers can gain insights into the specific needs, challenges, and disparities that exist within different localities. This information allows them to tailor policies and interventions to address the unique characteristics and requirements of each area, leading to more targeted and impactful solutions.

The utilization of subnational data and geospatial analysis plays a crucial role in identifying areas of concern, such as those marked with high poverty rates, inadequate access to necessities, or health disparities. With such information, resources can be allocated equitably and programs can directly address these specific issues of communities most at-risk, rather than implementing generalized approaches that may overlook the unique socioeconomic and spatial challenges.

Quality subnational demographic data, however, is often difficult to obtain. Organizations such as the United Nations, World Bank Group, Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program and various National Statistical Offices publish statistics at the national level, which poses a barrier to understanding how certain characteristics are spread throughout a country. An alternative to "official" data can be found from organizations whose missions are not inherently political.  

The purpose of this project is to propose a specific methodology for validating population subgroups, seeking to answer the question "Given a data source of unknown reputation, is it possible to extract any demographic information and determine if it is consistent with "official" sources?". An example using publicly available geospatial data is provided to illustrate the concept behind this methodology.
